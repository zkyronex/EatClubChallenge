# Fix SceneDelegate Not Being Called

The SceneDelegate's `willConnectTo` method is not being called because the project is still configured for SwiftUI's automatic scene generation.

## The Problem

Looking at your project.pbxproj, these settings are causing the issue:
- `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = YES` - Xcode is auto-generating Info.plist
- `INFOPLIST_KEY_UIApplicationSceneManifest_Generation = YES` - SwiftUI scene generation is enabled

## Solution: Update Build Settings in Xcode

1. **Open your project in Xcode**
2. **Select the EatClubChallenge project** (blue icon) in the navigator
3. **Select the EatClubChallenge target**
4. **Go to the Build Settings tab**
5. **Make sure "All" and "Combined" are selected** (not "Basic")

### Fix the Info.plist Settings:

1. **Search for**: `generate info`
   - Find `Generate Info.plist File` (GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE)
   - Change from `YES` to `NO`

2. **Search for**: `info.plist file`
   - Find `Info.plist File` (INFOPLIST_FILE)
   - Set to: `EatClubChallenge/Info.plist`

3. **Search for**: `scene manifest`
   - Find `UIApplicationSceneManifest Generation`
   - Either delete this row (click the minus button) or set to `NO`

### Important Keys to Remove/Disable:
- `INFOPLIST_KEY_UIApplicationSceneManifest_Generation`
- `INFOPLIST_KEY_UILaunchScreen_Generation` (if you want custom launch screen)

## After Making Changes:

1. **Clean Build Folder**: Product → Clean Build Folder (⇧⌘K)
2. **Delete Derived Data**:
   - Xcode → Settings → Locations
   - Click arrow next to Derived Data
   - Delete the EatClubChallenge folder
3. **Build and Run** again

## Verify It's Working:

Add a print statement in SceneDelegate:
```swift
func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
    print("✅ SceneDelegate willConnectTo called!")
    // rest of your code...
}
```

If you see this print in the console, the SceneDelegate is working correctly.
